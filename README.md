Ansible Attic Role
==================

An ansible role for installing and configuring Attic Backup.
The installation happens from source (picked up from git). So git needs to be present as a dependency role or ad it to the attic_dependency_pkgs variable.
You have 3 main sections in this role:

* installation of dependencies and Attic installation
* installation of the "server" part. This will create a dedicated user and set a public key on that user. This is the place where you can store your backups (remotely if you like)
* installation of the "client" part. This will set a private key on a dedicated backup user (for instance root), install the keychain manager so you can connect remotely and set a backup script for your backups + cronjob to execute the backup script
